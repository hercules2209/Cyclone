# Cyclone
This repository contains a model trained on infrared satellite images, that predicts the location of the cyclone eye in an image.
There are two ui files one of them has tries to zoom onto the cyclone eye It is not perfect but works well enough.
The other Ui contains a separate load button for laoding the model so that you can run more rpedictions before running out of memory.
The models are available at
